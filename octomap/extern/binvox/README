This directory contains the "binvox" Linux binaries 
(32 and 64 Bit), provided by Patrick Min at 
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~min/binvox

These binaries provide support for more 3D source files 
than the open source versions.

You can view "binvox" files with "viewvox".

-------------

Original README from binvox:


"binvox" reads a 3D model file and rasterizes it into
a 3D voxel grid. For documentation, go to
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~min/binvox

The binary versions, downloadable at
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~min/binvox, support several
3D file formats. The open source version supports the OBJ
3D file format (more formats will be added in the future).

compiling binvox
----------------

You need to have GLUT installed to compile binvox. You
can find it at http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html.
After you've compiled it, put the 'libglut.a' file in
the 'lib' subdirectory.


compiling under Linux
---------------------

cd binvox-0.37/vox/binvox
setenv OS LINUX
make


compiling under Mac OS X
------------------------

Download the xcode development environment from Apple.
Make sure you also install (find these in the Packages
folder of the disk image):
- gcc-4.0
- DeveloperTools
- DevSDK
- X11SDK

cd binvox-0.37/vox/binvox
setenv OS LINUX
make

The "OS" variable is still set to LINUX because of the
minor differences between the two. The makefiles rely
on an environment variable VENDOR to be set to "apple"
for the MAC OS X specific tweaks (so do a setenv VENDOR apple
if that one for some reason isn't set).



compiling under Windows
-----------------------

Install cygwin (available at www.cygwin.com). Make sure
to get gcc, tcsh, and make.

The steps below assume you've decompressed the binvox-0.37.tar.gz
to a directory C:\binvox-0.37

From a command shell (start -> run -> cmd), type:
- tcsh
- setenv OS WINDOWS
- cd /cygdrive/c/binvox-0.37/vox/binvox
- make

This will create binvox.exe in that same directory.
